“SmartBCH...a decentralized, high-throughput, low-cost, and easy-to-use infrastructure for cryptocurrency”
SmartBCH Whitepaper, April 2021


1.	AN ABSTRACT - THE EXCHANGE OF DIGITAL ASSETS

The liquidity of digital assets and value discovery of blockchain have always been enabled by centralized exchanges. However, amid the proliferation and relatively recent boom of digital assets, the audit token listing system of centralized exchanges has failed to meet the trading needs of the long tail market.

Demands for trading and liquidity from long-tail tokens gave birth to the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that later has embraced another boom with increasing automated market makers in the DeFi ﬁeld. These exchanges are, unlike CEX, where almost any token or coin that can create trading pairs can take place, as well as popular crypto currencies without restrictions.
This allows you to trade on exchanges without restrictions such as conditions or certain withdrawal amounts. However, even under such prosperity, problems such as poor user interface, user experience and limited transaction methods remain unsolved.

Centralized exchanges (or "CEX") have all of the conventional centralized order-book trading mechanisms. By contrast, decentralized exchanges (or "DEX") use smart contracts on-chain. For various transaction methods of both CEX and DEX, "price" is an essential factor. As cryptocurrencies are built on open blockchain networks, the formation of the "moderate price" is determined by free-market trading.





2.	WHY WE CHOSE SMARTBCH?

Ethereum has been the go-to blockchain for smart contract-based decentralized applications (dApps) for several years. This is due to the early adoption of Ethereum which gave the second-largest blockchain a head-start against any competition.  As this technology was only coming into development, the network effect of Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols has resulted in phenomenal growth and continued development and adoption.

However, there are concerns for some developers building on Ethereum regarding high gas fees, speed, and network congestion. Many believe this could hinder the mass adoption of crypto. However, several measures have been and are being taken to address this issue through scaling and interoperability in Ethereum 2.0.

Regardless, many crypto projects are opting to build on other blockchains due to lower transaction fees and less saturation, such as SmartBCH and Binance Smart Chain. Both these chains have considerably lower fees than Ethereum, lowering the barrier of entry for adoption while creating a cost-effective and secure platform for building dApps.

For all the benefits and advantages listed in the table above, we have selected SmartBCH to build our DEX and other related tools and initiatives on. This was only possible when SmartBCH was launched on 30 July 2021. In the SmartBCH whitepaper, the team’s emphasis was on building “a decentralized, high-throughput, low-cost, and easy-to-use infrastructure for cryptocurrency”. In essence, the developers believe SmartBCH will offer the same benefits as ETH 2.0 in a much shorter time.After its launch, our team had the opportunity to review the specifications of SmartBCH and interact widely with the BCH and SmartBCH community on milestone development.



SmartBCH is filling the gap of smart contracts, tokenization, and DeFi, which Bitcoin Cash was missing. There had been some developments previously, with SLP tokenization (another BCH layer-2), but DeFi development wasn’t possible. While some projects developed DeFi platforms, these were numbered and there wasn’t a background infrastructure to support them.


Moreover, SmartBCH offers a solution to current Ethereum DeFi projects that suffer from irrationally high fees during times of congestion of the ETH blockchain. SmartBCH, utilizing the extremely low fees of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, can support Ethereum projects that experience loss of traffic due to the high ETH gas fees.

With EVM interoperability, SmartBCH offers a tokenization process with the use of Solidity language. The tokens created within the SmartBCH network follow the SEP20 protocol and there are developments in protocol standards for NFTs that we will have more information on soon.

SmartBCH opens wide the gates of DeFi for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. It is a complete solution that not just creates a perfect environment for SmartBCH native projects, but can also attract the attention of established DeFi of Ethereum, due to the extremely low fees.

Practically for the user, this means a solid environment is ready and waiting for decentralized finance to be developed and the first ones to arrive will get the most attention from the community.

We can also expect SmartBCH to increase the current Bitcoin Cash user base and already thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts are flocking to the SmartBCH token communities. We are also very bullish about liquidity flowing into the SmartBCH ecosystem. It is still very early days in the BCH / SmartBCH community and roadmap. We expect the liquidity flowing in to increase significantly in the future as more exciting projects launch on SmartBCH.




3.	1BCH, A FULL SERVICE DECENTRALISED EXCHANGE

Since August 2021, the 1BCH team have been focused on creating a SmartBCH DEX, with its services deployed in a decentralized environment wherein these services can be autonomously and directly accessed by the Users without any involvement or actions taken by any third-party.

We are not the first DEX on SmartBCH. The other DEXes on SmartBCH are relatively new, and there are no established ones at the moment. Hence, in our view, it is beneficial that there are a few DEXes, which will compete for the attention of the SmartBCH community and improve technologically and launch new products. We firmly believe we have an incredible proposition and excellent team to contribute to the SmartBCH community.

As a DEX, at 1BCH.com, we will be delivering more DeFi functionalities than just a typical DEX which will create a more complete 1BCH DEX and DeFi experience on SmartBCH. Please see our “1BCH’s Roadmap” section below for more information.

We would like to share a few key principles and concepts we highly value when formulating our 1BCH DEX:

A.	Asset Control
DEXs do not usually and must not keep user funds. Therefore, you’re the only one in control over your own crypto currency. Users who want to trade on the decentralized exchange retain control of their funds for the entire transfer period.

B.	Process Continuity
While even seconds are valuable for users in an area with high market volatility, such as the cryptocurrency sector, the possibility of stopping transactions is minimized in decentralized exchanges because the distribution does not take place from a single point.

C.	Simplicity
On a DEX, your Private Key is regarded as your login information. After logging into DEX with your Private Key information, you can see your balance immediately. All you need to use a DEX is a crypto- currency wallet.



D.	Diversity

Since liquidity pools are created by traders in DEXs, when the re- quired supply and demand are provided, cryptocurrencies not yet listed by central exchanges can be found in decentralized exchanges

E.	Security
When decentralized exchanges transact on the blockchain, all information is stored on the blockchain. It’s nearly impossible to hack.

With the benefits of SmartBCH and these key principles and concepts, the 1BCH team particularly hopes that the issue of front-running which has plagued other blockchains (namely, Ethereum) will be minimised:

Ethereum has low throughput, which means only a low number of transactions can pass through on-chain. This allows miners to choose the order that blocks go onto the blockchain, and if users are not willing to pay higher gas fees, they have to wait for long periods. 
The process in which miners prioritize the blocks with the highest gas fees to earn an extra profit is known as front-running. With such high fees, it only makes financial sense for wealthy individuals or institutions to participate in DeFi activity at scale, which shifts the dynamic of the Ethereum network to a more “whale” dominated ecosystem. When you use a decentralized exchange (DEX), it’s common to see gas fees between $200-300. This process goes against the ideological foundations of crypto, which was designed to be decentralized with low barriers to entry.
SmartBCH attempts to solve front running problem of high transaction costs in by utilizing an extremely high throughput on the SmartBCH blockchain so that large amounts of data can quickly pass through transactions, reducing the transaction time.
SmartBCH also aims to reduce transaction fees by reordering the transactions in a “pseudorandom” way to make the prioritizing process more complex. The aim here is to prevent the validators from front-running blocks.




4.	1BCH’s DESIGN ARCHITECTURE

1BCH – an online, decentralized, peer-to-peer and autonomous environment that displays price information and autonomous smart contract mechanisms of digital tokens and assets , you can use to trade digital assets and 1BCH provides the user-interface that guides your access to 1BCH. 1BCH is made up of free, public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on the SmartBCH blockchain.


1BCH works as a Automated Market Making (AMA) DEXby providing liquidity pools for token pairs:
Liquidity providers (users) deposit funds to earn 0.17% trading fees (adjustable) by depositing an equal amount (in USD) of 2 tokens.
The AMA Pool rewards the user with LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens . These tokens represent this user’s ownership share in the pool (Liquidity Shares).
A trader can swap his token A against token B in the pool. By doing so he adds token A to the pool and receives token B (see price formula below).
Trading/Swapping against the pool does not change the liquidity shares (LP tokens) - except for a negligible amount of fees that are minted as new LP tokens. Liquidity providers still have the same percentage share of the pool. However due to a change in price of both assets in the pool (relative to the time liquidity was added) the amount of token A and B to be redeemed by Liquidity Providers is different. This difference is called impermanent loss.
Withdrawing liquidity from the pool means liquidity providers redeem their LP tokens (which have grown since deposit due to accumulated fees) to receive the corresponding percentage of token A and B from the pool.


The price formula for swaps against the pool is: x * y = k where:
x: balance token A
y: pool balance token B
k: a constant defined at initial deposit (pool creation)


5.	Tokenomics and Governance

Overall Supply and Public Sales
There will be a fixed supply of 250 million 1BCH tokens. We have distributed / will be distributing 10% of the 1BCH tokens across our Pre-Sale and Main Sale with the following listing prices respectively:

Pre-Sale: 5M 1BCH tokens to be distributed at the rate of 1 BCH = 100,000 1BCH tokens
4M 1BCH tokens to be distributed via BCHPad for 40 BCH
1M 1BCH tokens to be distributed via Flipstarter for 10 BCH
Main Sale: 20M 1BCH tokens and at 1 BCH = 50,000 1BCH tokens or the prevailing average 1BCH token price (whichever is higher) within 2 months of launch of 1BCH.com DEX

Team Tokens & Credibility Assurance
Our team will keep 20% of the 1BCH tokens so that our team is well aligned in the success of what we are doing. Our team will have a lockup period of 12 months for our tokens so none of our team members is allowed to sell our tokens during the next 12 months. 

When 1BCH.com is officially launched on the SmartBCH Mainnet, we will do a third party audit prior to our main sale. We understand that our credibility and security of 1BCH.com is crucial to our community. Hence, in relation to the team tokens and funds raised during our pre-sale and main sale, we have made the following commitments and have in place the following additional measures for security and assurance to the 1BCH and wider blockchain communities:

Private Doxx Audit by BCHPad: We have undergone and passed a private doxx audit by BCHPad. 
Involvement in the BCH community: As mentioned below in the “1BCH’s Team” section, we have been involved in the BCH and SmartBCH community for a significant time. Our website 1BCH.com has been active since 2018 as a BCH-focused exchange. Please see Web Archive links: https://web.archive.org/web/20190615000000*/1bch.com

1BCH’s Open Source Code: Our open source codes can be found here: https://github.com/1bch for everyone to review. 

Locking of Tokens: All the team tokens will be locked for a period of 12 months (from close of pre-sale) using an accredited and audited third party lock-script, such as smartbchlock.bscrypt.finance

Locking of Funds raised: 50% of the funds we raise in our pre-sale will be locked for a period of 6 months (from close of pre-sale) using the same accredited and audited third party lock-script as mentioned above


Tokens for 1BCH’s Development
The remaining 70% of the tokens will be allocated towards community development, marketing, staking rewards, liquidity pool, and partnerships. The 1BCH tokens have a fixed supply and there will be no new tokens minted after the Pre-sales is funded successfully.

Introducing rBCH Token, and it’s relationship with the 1BCH Tokens
We have our main token 1BCH with a fixed supply of 250 million tokens. 1BCH tokens are a token standard native to and the focus asset of 1BCH DEX. It is an SEP20 standard token with token burning added, but not minting. Thus, the supply of 1BCH tokens will always decrease. We will release our token burning schedule at a later point in time after our 1 BCH DEX launch, once we see how many active users our platform has after 2-3 months.

As the main token of our DEX, the 1BCH token will have DEX pool pairs to all prominent coins on our DEX. Thereafter, we have our farming token rBCH which is minted on all farms to generate yield for staking LP tokens. Hence, it is required that this token has unlimited supply. This is the same mechanism as on other prominent DEXes: SushiSwap, PancakeSwap (CAKE token), Mistswap, etc. All their yield tokens have unlimited supply and are generated at a configured rate per pool to reward staking. For PancakeSwap, for example, this idea corresponds to: (i) 1BCH = BNB; and (ii) rBCH = CAKE.

6-month Yield Guarantee
We chose this split into 2 tokens (1BCH and rBCH tokens) to get the best of both worlds: limited token supply plus high and configurable yields. Other than that, we provide a 6 months price guarantee for the exchange rate of 1BCH:rBCH = 1:100. This is so that our users can use our 1BCH DEX with the confidence of knowing that your tokens from high yield farms can be converted to another token with limited supply (1BCH).

Utility of 1BCH Tokens
Once the 1BCH DEX and its features are fully launched, the 1BCH tokens will have the following features in line with the roadmap as shared in the “1BCH Roadmap” section below:
Voting on Governance Proposals: Upgrades and modifications to 1BCH are managed in a community-driven way by holders of the 1BCH governance token. 
Staking: Users can stake their LP tokens (which they receive for providing liquidity in a pool) from various popular pools to earn rBCH as reward. Each block mints 11 rBCH (configurable) shared amongst participants in the staking farm.
Swapping (trading) against the pool has an associated fee of 0.25% of the exchanged amount. 0.17% of that fee is rewarded to the Liquidity Providers in the pool while the remaining 0.08% goes to the DEX operators.
Listing of 3rd party tokens on our 1BCH DEX will require such 3rd parties hold a designated number of 1BCH tokens
